You are an expert JavaScript game developer. 

Please help me build a very simple Super Mario-style platformer using the Kaboom.js game framework. 

Here are my requirements:
- Use a plain HTML + JavaScript setup (no build tools).
- Include Kaboom.js via CDN.
- Create a playable character (a block for now) that can:
  - Move left and right using the arrow keys.
  - Jump when the spacebar is pressed.
- Add a ground platform and basic gravity.
- Detect collisions so the character doesnâ€™t fall through the ground.
- Clearly comment every part of the code (since I am a beginner).
- Keep the code as simple and readable as possible.

Please provide:
1. A complete `index.html` example.
2. An explanation for every important line.
